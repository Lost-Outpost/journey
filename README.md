"You realize that all your life you have been coasting along as if you were in a dream. Suddenly, facing the trials of the last few days, you have come alive."

Journey is a simple modlist designed to give a vanilla-like graphical presentation and provide a solid Vanilla+ gameplay overhaul with an optional survival component using SunHelm. Journey's purpose is to provide a base graphical and gameplay overhaul to play Skyrim fairly close to how the game was or to add on your own choice of followers, quests, and new lands beyond what is already included.

Journey is designed and made for Skyrim: Special Edition with minimal AE content support for the free Creation Club content that Bethesda added with the Anniversary Edition update.
