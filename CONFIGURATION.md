# Configuration

- [Anniversary Edition](#anniversary-edition)
- [ENB Organizer](#enb-organizer)
- [Graphics Options](#graphics-options)
- [Optionals](#optionals)

## Mod Organizer 2 Profiles

Journey comes with two profiles in MO2. Journey and Journey - Anniversary Edition. If you don't own Anniversary Edition and all of the creation club content that comes with it, play the default Journey profile. It contains the full Journey experience outside of creation club integration.

## Anniversary Edition

The Anniversary Edition profile requires a copy of all of the creation club mod files in order to use it.

- Launch Skyrim through Steam and allow it to download all creation club content.
- In Mod Organizer 2, activate the Anniversary Edition profile.
- Right click on `[NoDelete] Creation Club - Paid` and select `Open in Explorer`.
- Copy all files from your `Skyrim Special Edition\data`folder that begin with "cc" into the opened folder.
- Make sure all creation club content is enabled under the `Plugins` tab on the right pane in Mod Organizer 2.
- If it is not, shift-click on `[NoDelete] Creation Club - Paid`, right click and select `Enable Selected`, and finally right click and select `Send to > Top`.

## ENB Organizer
Journey includes the tool ENB Organizer for trying out different ENB and ReShade presets.

To change ENB or ReShade presets:
- Run ENB Organizer from the left side bar in Mod Organizer 2 or from the exe list on the top right.
- If ENB Organizer gives a warning about being unable to check for updates, click okay and ignore it.
- In the left side menu, go to `Presets`.
- Disable the currently enabled preset and enable the one you wish to use.

> Do not enable more than one preset at a time. If you want to enable the included Rudy ENB, you must enable `Rudy ENB - Required Files` under Optionals in MO2 and move the `Obsidian Weathers - Patch - Rudy ENB.esb` below `Obsidian Weathers.esp` in the plugins list.

## Graphics Options

>For Improved performance, try turning off any ENB preset and enable one of the included reshade presets.

Journey's default graphics settings are set to its `Medium` preset. For better performance or visuals, you can select one of the other included graphics configs included in the `Journey/Graphics Presets` folder into the `Profiles/[Journey]/[Journey - Anniversary Edition]` profile folder that you are using.

## Optionals

Journey includes a small amount of optional content for you to play with, if you want.

### Additional Followers and Companions

Included, but disabled by default, are a number of optional companions for your travels in Skyrim and can be found under `New Followers` in Mod Organizer 2.

- Enable the companion under `New Followers` that you want to enable.
- Move all enabled plugins above `RealisticWaterTwo.esp`

### Optional Tweaks

Also included are a number of optional tweaks under `Optionals` in the Mod List. Simply follow the directions under `Notes` for enabling or disabling them.
